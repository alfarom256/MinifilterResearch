### What is a FS Minifilter
This research is focused only on non-legacy minifilter drivers.

File system minifilters are drivers which are used to inspect, log, modify, or prevent file system I/O operations. The filter manager driver (FltMgr.sys) effectively "sits in-between" the I/O Manager and the File System Driver, and is responsible for registration of file system minifilter drivers, and the invocation of their pre and post-operation callbacks. 

>A minifilter driver attaches to the file system stack indirectly, by registering with _FltMgr_ for the I/O operations that the minifilter driver chooses to filter.

FltMgr also maintains a list of volumes attached to the system, and is responsible for storing and invoking callbacks on a per-volume basis.
